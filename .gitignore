# Note: package-lock.json is usually recommended to be committed,
# but if you prefer to rely solely on package.json or use yarn/pnpm, you might ignore it.
# However, for stability, standard practice is to KEEP package-lock.json.
# I will NOT ignore package-lock.json by default unless requested.
# If you want to ignore it, uncomment the line above.

# Cloud Functions
cloudfunctions/**/node_modules/

# Note: Cloud functions usually need their own node_modules uploaded or installed.
# Identifying whether to ignore them depends on deployment strategy.
# Usually, we ignore local node_modules and rely on cloud installation or upload.
# But often we DO commit package-lock.json in cloud functions for consistent installs.
# I will ignore node_modules but keep package-lock.json for cloud functions.
